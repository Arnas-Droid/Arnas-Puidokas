# Introduction
This website is to showcase my porgrams that I have done. My favourite topic in programming is graphics.

(Currently work in progress website)

## Favourite subject
For me graphics has been my favourite subject to learn about. It all started with glut, and moved to more modern API DX11.

### DX11 Graphics 
This is the newest piece of graphics prgramming that I did. We used DX11 to create a scene.
